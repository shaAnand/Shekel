# First

First, let’s start with what money is. Sounds simple, but I bet you that only top 1% really understand what money is. I am certainly not in that 1%. In my research I found MIT course ‘Blockchain and Money’ [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/index.htm) by Prof. Gary Gensler very informative. It’s more than 30+ hour, but definitely worth your time. 

# Second

Read the original Bitcoin whitepaper [here](https://downloads.coindesk.com/research/whitepapers/bitcoin.pdf) by Satoshi Nakamoto. If you know who he is, then do let me know :). Jokes apart, this whitepaper is beautifully written for broad audience reach. I personally have to read it multiple times to understand.
